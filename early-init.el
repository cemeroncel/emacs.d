;;;; Tricks for faster startup
;; Increase the Garbage Collection (GC) threshold
;; temporarly. Following Prot
;; https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/early-init.el,
;; we save its default value to a variable, and restore it after
;; startup has completed. Prot also does a similar trick for
;; `file-name-handler-alist' and `vc-handled-backends' by setting them
;; to `nil' temporarily. I should check these to see it they make a
;; speed difference.
(defvar ce/gc-cons-threshold gc-cons-threshold
  "Default value of the `gc-cons-threshold'.")
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (setq gc-cons-threshold ce/gc-cons-threshold)))

;; By default, resizing a frame rounds it sized to the frame's current
;; values of `frame-char-height' and `frame-char-width'. Setting this
;; to a non-nil value prevents the rounding, so the frame sizes can
;; increase/decrase by one pixel.
(setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)

;; Make the initial buffer load faster by setting its mode to fundamental-mode.
(customize-set-variable 'initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode)

;; Do not resize the frame at this early stage
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Do not use X resources. I still didn't understand what these are
;; but I'm disabling them for now.
(setq inhibit-x-resources t)

;; Inhibits display of buffer list when more than 2 files are loaded.

;;;; Removing graphical elements

;;;; Native comp settings

  ;; Do not report warnings and error from asynchronous native
  ;; compilation. I might turn this on later for debugging purposes.

;; Location of the native compilation cache
